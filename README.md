# VirtuelCPU

#### Make the server run:
- java -jar VirtuelCPU-jar-with-dependencies.jar

#### Run the code(program) from the text file:
- load CodeTailRecursion.txt


### Functional Programming 
Normally when a function is called it saves the information on the call stack, that is a list of return locations in order.

#### Tail Recursion
- When a function is calling another/the same function as the last operation
- No need for the computer to remember the caller (returne address)
- The called function will return directly to the original caller.
